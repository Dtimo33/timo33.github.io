            <p> My name is Timothy D Asberry. I grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland OH. I previously had no coding experience before this program but have been fully dedicated to learning as many coding languages as possible. Not only am I looking for a new career but I would like to also pursue a personal hobby of mine in game development. I hope that you read through my website and enjoy my work!</p>

        <p>Amazon</p>
